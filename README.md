# templateJs  

## Description  
templateJs is a dumb front templating lib based on the good old html template tag.  

## WhatIsIt  

This let you build components based on templates.  
Template demos samples can be found in src/template folder.  
Core lib can be found in src/js/Template.js.  
Components can be found in src/js/components folder.  
This is a dry prototyped (100 lines of code), poor but fast.  
From the demo I've had components on a sample html page to make it easy.  

## Who  

I'm a freelancer, you can get more on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pierre-fromager-197b4b6/ "My profile").  

## Whom  

I'm using as daily front libs (React, Angular, View ) and such techs based on dom shadowing.  
Sometimes apprehend,asimilate such technologies can take time.  
On that points I wondered if maybe I could help to make the learning curve shorter.  
So I deciced to publish this use case.  
For fresh people coming to js, some concepts can be murky regarding asynchronicity .  
For them have a look at Promises usage.  

## Facility  
A server is available listening on default tcp port 3333, to make it run type :  

```bash
npm run server
```

You can change settings in the server/config.js file.  
Once server started, you can figure out from shell what kind of resource is loaded by colors.  
On this point change colors settings in the server/colors.js file.  

## Dependencies  

Node and npm required for the demo server but no external dependency is required to run Template.js.
